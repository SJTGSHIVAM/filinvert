# filinvert

Dark Theme or Dark mode feature is much loved but alas! Even some most common websites do not support it yet. filinvert is here to fill the gap it coverts your light mode website to dark mode just by a click. We do not mess a lot with light theme so it might not work perfectly on some but it still save a lot of hassle. Filinvert inverts page's css to achieve dark theme effect for light theme websites. You just have to install it and it is available on single right click. We don't take any statistics and no other fancy stuff behind the scenes.
